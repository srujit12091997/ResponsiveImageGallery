# Responsive Image Gallery

A simple, responsive image gallery built using HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates how to create a responsive layout that adjusts based on the screen size and implements hover effects on images to display an overlay with a title.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The gallery layout adjusts automatically to different screen sizes:
  - On larger screens (desktops), images are displayed in 3 columns.
  - On tablets, images are displayed in 2 columns.
  - On mobile devices, images are displayed in 1 column.
  
- **Hover Effect**: Each image has a hover effect that scales the image slightly and displays a transparent overlay with a title.
  
- **CSS Flexbox**: The layout is built using modern CSS flexbox, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for the structure of the image gallery.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the gallery, hover effects, and responsive behavior.
